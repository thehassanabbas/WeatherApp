# WeatherApp
 Welcome to my Weather App project! This web application allows users to input the name of any city and retrieve the current temperature for that location, displayed seamlessly on the screen. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing a blend of modern web development techniques and responsive design principles.
